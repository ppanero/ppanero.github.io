      I'm Pablo Panero, a software developer based in Geneva (Switzerland).
      I'm currently working at CERN, as part of the Digital Repositories team.

      As for me... I like to build stuff, mostly software, but I am also a huge fan of carpentry.
      I also like to optimize processes. When you live in a small space, every bit of space counts -
      the same applies to software -. Yeah... I like my monitoring graphics display green.

      Last but not least, I like solving challenges at all scales: From sudokus to complex
      software architectures.
